<h1>How can I access support from a CLIC Sargent health or social care professional?</h1>
<p1>After diagnosis a CLIC Sargent Social Worker at the principal treatment centre should be in touch. They will meet with you face-to-face to assess your familyâ€™s needs. This could be at your home or in hospital. They can apply for a CLIC Sargent standard grant on your behalf; provide benefits and other practical information, and signpost you to other services if you need. In most principal treatment centres you can also access a CLIC Sargent Key Worker who will help to coordinate care in hospital and at home.

To find your nearest treatment centre and CLIC Sargent Team please visit the in my area page.</p1>
