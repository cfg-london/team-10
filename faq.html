<h1>How can I access support from a CLIC Sargent health or social care professional?</h1>
<p1>After diagnosis a CLIC Sargent Social Worker at the principal treatment centre should be in touch. They will meet with you face-to-face to assess your family’s needs. This could be at your home or in hospital. They can apply for a CLIC Sargent standard grant on your behalf; provide benefits and other practical information, and signpost you to other services if you need. In most principal treatment centres you can also access a CLIC Sargent Key Worker who will help to coordinate care in hospital and at home.
